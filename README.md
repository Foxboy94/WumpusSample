# WumpusSample
Sample code for the Minds and Machines Wumpus World project

How to use:
Main.c is the file you will want to compile, as it imports
  the movement functions on its own. It additionally has
  simple import parsing. To fine tune the movement functions
  to work for your robot, edit the #defines at the top of
  the movement.c file. The section for #defines is labelled
  by a large comment block, as is the section where the
  functions are defined, which normally should not be edited.
